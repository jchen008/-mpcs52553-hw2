### Getting Started

1. Download a ZIP file of this repository, unzip it into a folder, and then convert that folder
into your own git repository.  (Alternatively, you can clone this repository and then use `git remote set-url...` to point to your remote repository instead.)
2. Create a remote repository (GitHub or BitBucket) called `mpscs52553-hw2`.
2. Follow the instructions below.
3. Commit often.  Push often.
4. Add collaborators:
    * GitHub: jahnagoldman, ekxue, jeffcohen
    * BitBucket: jahnamcnamara, ekxue, jeffcohen
5. Make sure your final commit is timestamped before the deadline, and everything is pushed to your remote repository by the deadline.


### Instructions

This assignment will help you get practice with page layout and
JavaScript fundamentals.  Some research might be required.


1. CSS Page Layout Challenge
  * Take a look at the "above the fold" screenshot I took of the [Etsy home page](etsy.png).
  * Think about how you would begin to build this page yourself.
    * Can you organize the design into a series of rows?
    * Within each row, can you identify the columns?
  * Modify [etsy.html](etsy.html) so that it looks as like the screenshot.
  * You can add as many other files as needed (for example, you should add a CSS file instead
    of using a `<style>` element in the HTML itself).
  * You can use the Bootstrap framework or your own code (I'd suggest flexbox or CSS grid).
  * It will NOT be possible to build an exact replica, because they use
    a commercial font that costs a lot of money.  You can use
    the "system font" instead.  Use this tutorial: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/
  * You are encouraged to study and/or steal from  the live https://www.etsy.com/ to determine margins,
    colors, the orange checkmarks, and anything else that you would find helpful
    (assuming their home page hasn't changed drastically by the time
    you work on this assignment).
  * Because the live site may have changed by the time you work on this
    assignment, I saved two images called etsy2.jpg and etsy3.jpg
    for you to use.
  * The page should respond appropriately to mobile devices: [etsy_mobile.png](etsy_mobile.png)

  * Grading Rubric:
    * 4 points: Overall layout matches (proper rows and columns)
    * 3 points: Overall mobile layout matches (see [etsy_mobile.png](etsy_mobile.png))
    * 2 points: Reasonable choice of typography (use the "system font" trick mentioned above
      or pick your own fonts), reasonable match of font weights and color schemes
    * 1 points: Fine details: rounded corners as needed, icons in toolbar, nice search form with seamless "Search" button, orange custom checkmarks, placeholder text ("Search for items or shops") in search form.
